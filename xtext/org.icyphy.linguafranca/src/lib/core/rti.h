 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Header file for the runtime infrastructure for distributed Lingua Franca programs.
 *
 * This file defines the message types for the federate to communicate with the RTI.
 * Each message type has a unique one-byte ID.
 *
 * The startup sequence is as follows:
 *
 * Each federate attempts to connect with an RTI at the IP address
 * put into its code by the code generator (i.e., it attempts to
 * open a TCP connection). It starts by trying the
 * port number given by STARTING_PORT and increments the port number
 * from there until it successfully connects. The maximum port number
 * it will try before giving up is STARTING_PORT + PORT_RANGE_LIMIT.
 *
 * FIXME: What if a port is specified in the "at" of the federated statement?
 *
 * When it has successfully opened a TCP connection, the first message it sends
 * to the RTI is a FED_ID message, which contains the ID of this federate
 * within the federation, contained in the global variable _lf_my_fed_id
 * in the federate code
 * (which is initialized by the code generator) and the unique ID of
 * the federation, a GUID that is created at run time by the generated script
 * that launches the federation.
 * If you launch the federates and the RTI manually, rather than using the script,
 * then the federation ID is a string that is optionally given to the federate
 * on the command line when it is launched. The federate will connect
 * successfully only to an RTI that is given the same federation ID on
 * its command line. If no ID is given on the command line, then the
 * default ID "Unidentified Federation" will be used.
 *
 * The RTI will respond with a REJECT message if the federation IDs
 * do not match and close the connection. At this point the federate
 * will increment the port number and try again to find an RTI that matches.
 *
 * When the federation IDs match, the RTI will respond with an
 * ACK.
 *
 * The next message to the RTI will a UDP_PORT message, which has
 * payload USHRT_MAX if clock synchronization is disabled altogether, 0 if
 * only initial clock synchronization is enabled, and a port number for
 * UDP communication if runtime clock synchronization is enabled.
 * By default, if the federate host is identical to that of the RTI
 * (either no "at" clause is given for either or they both have exactly
 * the same string), then clock synchronization is disabled.
 * Otherwise, the default is that initial clock synchronization is enabled.
 * To turn turn off clock synchronization altogether, set the clock-sync
 * property of the target to off. To turn on runtime clock synchronization,
 * set it to on. The default value is initial.
 *
 * If initial clock sync is enabled, the next step is to perform the initial
 * clock synchronization (using the TCP connection), which attempts
 * to find an initial offset to the physical clock of the federate to make it
 * better match the physical clock at the RTI.
 *
 * Clock synchronization is initiated by the RTI by sending a message
 * of type PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T1, the payload of which is the
 * current physical clock reading at the RTI. The federate records
 * the physical time when it receives this message (T2) and sends
 * a reply message of type PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T3 to the RTI.
 * It records the time (T3) at which this message has gone out.
 * The payload of the PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T3 message is the
 * federate ID.  The RTI responds to the T3 message with a message
 * of type PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T4, which has as a payload
 * the physical time at which that response was sent. This cycle will happen
 * _LF_CLOCK_SYNC_EXCHANGES_PER_INTERVAL times at startup to account for network delay variations
 * (see below).
 *
 * The times T1 and T4 are taken from the physical clock at the RTI,
 * whereas the times T2 and T3 are taken from the physical clock at
 * the federate.  The round trip latency on the connection to the RTI
 * is therefore measured as (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2). Half this quantity
 * is an estimate L of the one-way latency.  The estimated clock error
 * E is therefore L - (T2 - T1). Over several cycles, the average value of E
 * becomes the initial offset for the
 * clock at the federate. Henceforth, when get_physical_time() is
 * called, the offset will be added to whatever the physical clock says.
 *
 * If clock synchronization is enabled, then the federate will also
 * start a thread to listen for incoming UDP messages from the RTI.
 * With period given by _LF_CLOCK_SYNC_PERIOD_NS, the RTI
 * will initiate a clock synchronization round by sending to the
 * federate a PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T1 message. A similar
 * protocol to that above is followed to estimate the average clock
 * synchronization error E, with two exceptions. First, a fraction
 * of E (given by _LF_CLOCK_SYNC_ATTENUATION) is used to adjust the
 * offset up or down rather than just setting the offset equal to E.
 * Second, after PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T4, the RTI immediately
 * sends a following message of type PHYSICAL_CLOCK_SYNC_MESSAGE_T4_CODED_PROBE.
 * The federate measures the time difference between its receipt of
 * T4 and this code probe and compares that time difference against
 * the time difference at the RTI (the difference between the two
 * payloads). If that difference is larger than CLOCK_SYNC_GUARD_BAND
 * in magnitude, then the clock synchronization round is skipped
 * and no adjustment is made. The round will also be skipped if
 * any of the expected UDP messages fails to arrive.
 *
 * FIXME: Citation needed here.
 *
 * The next step depends on the coordination mode. If the coordination
 * parameter of the target is "decentralized" and the federate has
 * inbound connections from other federates, then it starts a socket
 * server to listen for incoming connections from those federates.
 * It attempts to create the server at the port given by STARTING_PORT,
 * and if this fails, increments the port number from there until a
 * port is available. It then sends to the RTI an ADDRESS_AD message
 * with the port number as a payload. The federate then creates a thread
 * to listen for incoming socket connections and messages.
 *
 * If the federate has outbound connections to other federates, then it
 * establishes a socket connection to those federates.  It does this by
 * first sending to the RTI an ADDRESS_QUERY message with the payload
 * being the ID of the federate it wishes to connect to. If the RTI
 * responds with a -1, then the RTI does not (yet) know the remote federate's
 * port number and IP address, so the local federate will try again
 * after waiting ADDRESS_QUERY_RETRY_INTERVAL. When it gets a valid port
 * number and IP address in reply, it will establish a socket connection
 * to that remote federate.
 *
 * FIXME: Don't physical connections also use the above P2P sockets between
 * federates? Even if the coordination is centralized...
 *
 * FIXME: What happens after this?
